    "explanation": "You are in the process of documenting Sequence Activities, which define four kinds of dependencies or logical relationships between project activities. Start to finish (SF) relationship, which denotes completion of successor activity, depends on initiation of predecessor activity. For example, activity A may have a start-to-finish relationship with activity B; this implies that B doesn't finish before A starts. This relationship is rarely used and uncommonly found in real life situations. An example could be a call center environment where the previous shift doesn't finish until the next one starts.",

A Project Manager is using the project charter to assess the detailed project requirements in consultation with the stakeholders and to establish the key project deliverables. He sets his project quality objective based on the organization capability baseline set by the quality policy. However, one of the stakeholders refuses to accept this and asks him to reduce the quality objective as it will help cut down cost of quality of the project. He also refuses to approve the project if the Project Manager does not agree to his suggestion. What should the Project Manager do?",

During the planning stage, you created a communication management plan based on the project organization structure and external stakeholder requirements in order to manage the flow of project information. During project execution, one of the stakeholders contacts you and informs you that his expectations have not been completely accounted for in the project. What should be your BEST response to the situation?",

Managing stakeholder expectations and establishing an effective communication with them is one of the most critical activities for project success. The Project Manager should update the project documents according to the requirements of the stakeholders. Option (b) is incorrect as all the stakeholders in the project need to be identified and their expectations managed throughout the project. Option (c) is incorrect as there is no reference in the question to suggest that more stakeholders might have been missed in the project. Option (d) is incorrect approach.

The total possible communication channels = n*(n-1)/2, where n is the number of stakeholders in the project. When the technical architect was part of the project team, there were 14 stakeholders, which made a total of [(14*13)/2] = 91 channels. When the technical architect left the project team and two new test engineers were added, there were 15 stakeholders, which made a total of [(15*14)/2] =105 channels.

This two-factor theory states that there are certain factors in the workplace that cause job satisfaction, while a separate set of factors cause dissatisfaction. The two-factor theory distinguishes between Motivators (e.g., challenging work, recognition, responsibility) that give positive satisfaction and arise from intrinsic conditions of the job itself, such as recognition, achievement, or personal growth, and Hygiene factors (e.g. status, job security, salary, and fringe benefits) that do not give positive satisfaction, although dissatisfaction results from their absence. These are extrinsic to the work itself and include aspects such as company policies, supervisory practices, or wages/salary. Essentially, hygiene factors are needed to ensure that an employee is satisfied. Motivation factors are needed to motivate an employee to higher performance. In this question, the Project Manager has only changed the hygiene factors without any change in the motivation factors. Thus, the employee remains unhappy and dissatisfied.",

A project manager is expected to integrate the project management processes and coordinate the process phases through the project management cycle to ensure that all areas of the project come together to deliver a successful conclusion. Integration involves not only pulling up all aspects of project management like scope, cost, schedule, quality, and communication for your project needs, but also working with other departments like legal, human resources, training, contract administration, and information technology which are impacted by your project.",

      "A": "Project cost estimating is primarily concerned with cost of the resources needed to complete the project and need not consider any other costs",
      "B": "Since it is the initial stage of the project, cost details required for Life Cycle costing of the project are not available and hence it is not relevant",

    "explanation": "Life cycle costing provides the lowest long term cost of ownership and should be used as a management decision tool. Project cost management is primarily concerned with the cost of resources needed to complete the project. (Option [a] is partly true.) Project cost management should also consider the effect of project decisions on the subsequent recurring cost of using, maintaining, and supporting the project.

Since the project is already initiated and is in the planning stage, option (a) and (d) can't be true. There is no evidence to believe option (b).

Some variation may be the result of causes which are not normally present in the process. This could be a special cause of variation. Some variation is simply the result of numerous, ever present differences in the process. This is a common cause of variation. Control charts differentiate between these two types of variation. It also presents a graphic display of process stability or instability over time. Process stability is defined as a state in which a process has displayed a certain degree of consistency in the past and is expected to continue to do so in the future.",

Cost plus fixed fee contracts pay a pre-determined fee that was agreed upon at the time of contract formation. In a cost-plus-incentive fee contract, a larger fee is awarded for contracts which meet or exceed performance targets including cost savings. Cost plus award fee contracts pay a fee based upon the contractor's work performance. In some contracts, the fee is determined subjectively by an awards fee board, whereas in others, the fee is based upon objective performance metrics. Cost plus percentage of cost contracts pay a fee that rises as the contractor\u0092s costs rise. Since this contract type provides no incentive for the contractor to control costs, it is rarely utilized and is most risky for the buyer.",

It is mostly used in the manufacturing industry. CMMI or Capability Maturity Model Integration is used mostly in the software industry. It is not a standard but a set of best practices. BS or British standards from British Standard Institute help organizations improve their quality and performance, reduce their risk, manage and protect their reputations, and be more sustainable. IEEE is Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. It provides standards in some of the areas, like software test documentation, software unit testing, and Quality assurance planning.

To differentiate project scope from product scope read through the definition of each. Product scope: the features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result. Project scope: the work that needs to be accomplished to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions. The product scope describes the function or service that will exist as a result of your project. The project scope, on the other hand, describes all the work to create the product scope. It includes only the required work to complete the project deliverable. Note: The completion of project scope is measured against the project management plan, the project scope statement and its associated Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS dictionary, and scope baseline. Completion of product scope is measured against product features or requirements.",

In this case, the only way to improve a process is to make a fundamental change, for example, upgrade equipment, change procedures, or provide more training.

It may not be true now since some work has been done, and the Project Manager is in a better position to negotiate. Also, since there are too many change requests with no clarity on how many of them would be approved, it is difficult for the Project Manager to continue work. The best option for the Project Manager in this case is Option A,.",
